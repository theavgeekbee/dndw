      <h1>dndw: vibe coding</h1>
      <p>Welcome to dndw! A blog where you listen to a 15 year old ramble about coding like an old man.</p>
      <h2>wth is vibe coding?</h2>
      <p>Vibe coding is basically using AI to code your entire project. Basically, instead of being a programmer, you become a full time prompt engineer and 
        instead of actual coding, you have AI do it for you. The idea is that it lets beginners code easier.</p>

      <h2>this sounds great! why are you complaining</h2>
      <p>Before you ask, <span class="red">no, I'm not secretly an 80-year-old</span>. I have more reasons to dislike it, trust me.</p>
      <p>The whole point of vibe coding is that it is <span class="blue">helping beginners</span> by making coding <span class="blue">more accessible</span>.
        It's also supposed to teach <span class="blue">concepts that you would normally need a classroom to learn</span>.</p> 
      <p>However, this is reaching very far here, and it usually never happens in real life.</p>

      <h2>what do you mean?</h2>
      <p>Let me take you on the journey of an individual on X, formerly known as Twitter, named Leo.</p>
      <p>Leo is a non-technical person making a successfull SaaS (Software as a Service) using <span class="blue">Cursor (an AI based IDE)</span>.</p>
      <p>He successfully ships the app and then starts <span class="blue">making money</span> (yayyy!! &#127881;).</p>
      <p>Then, his app comes under a <span class="red">cyberattack</span>. Weird requests are being spammed, usage limits are being reached.</p>
      <p>After spending so much time figuring out how to rectify the situation, he ends up <span class="blue">fixing it</span>. Eventually though, he decides it was too much.</p>

      <p>Here's how it ends:</p>

      <button hx-on:click="htmx.toggleClass(htmx.find('#twitter-embed-1'), 'noshow')">&darr; look here &darr;</button>
      <div id="twitter-embed-1" class="noshow">
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">i&#39;m shutting down my app ðŸ˜‘<br><br>Cursor just keeps breaking other parts of the code<br><br>you guys were right, I shouldnâ€™t have deployed unsecured code to production<br><br>I&#39;ll just rebuild it with Bubble, a more user friendly and secure platform for non techies like me<br><br>I appreciate everyoneâ€¦</p>&mdash; leo (@leojr94_) <a href="https://twitter.com/leojr94_/status/1902537756674318347?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
      </div>

      <h2>so what can we learn?</h2>
      <p>While you might be able to gaslight yourself into <span class="red">thinking you are learning</span>, when push comes to shove, hackers can REALLY <span class="red">shove</span>.
        Truth be told, cyberattacks don't really happen through <span class="blue">ultra-clandestine zero-day</span> vulnerabilities anymore (or at least, very infrequently).</p>
      <p>When you code, you need to <span class="blue">understand your framework</span>. And if you don't bad things like this can be a huge headache.</p>
      <p>You should only vibe code if you <span class="blue">know what you're doing</span>. You know how to prevent bad things from happening, and that will save a lot of debugging and headaches
        in the future. I myself use AI coding tools a lot, but when they get misused, bad things happen, especially when you're <span class="blue">building in public</span>.</p>
